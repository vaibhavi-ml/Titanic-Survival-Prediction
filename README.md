# Titanic Survival Prediction (Beginner ML Project)

This is one of my first machine learning projects.  
I used the Titanic dataset to explore the data, understand patterns, and build a simple model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## 📌 What I Did
- Loaded the Titanic dataset and checked for missing values  
- Performed basic EDA (age distribution, gender survival rate, passenger class, etc.)  
- Cleaned the data (handled missing age values, encoded categorical columns)  
- Built a few ML models and compared their accuracy  
- Selected the model that gave the best performance

## 📊 Key Observations
Some things I noticed during the analysis:
- Females had a much higher survival rate  
- Passengers in 1st class survived more than 2nd/3rd class  
- Younger passengers had better chances of survival  
- Fare seemed to affect survival in some cases  

These patterns helped me understand the data better before training any model.

## 🤖 Model Used
I tried basic models like:
- Logistic Regression  

You can check the notebook to see how each model performed.

## 🧪 Results
- Best model accuracy: 0.7821229050279329
- The model mainly relied on features like **Sex**, **Pclass**, **Age**, and **Fare**

## 📚 Dataset
Titanic dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## 🚀 What I Want to Improve Next
- Try hyperparameter tuning  
- Try more ML models  
- Add more feature engineering  
- Maybe deploy it in the future

## 🙌 About Me
I’m currently learning machine learning and this project helped me understand EDA, preprocessing, and model building in a practical way.
